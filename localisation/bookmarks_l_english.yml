 BM_HISTORY_TITLE:0 "Brief History"
 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "End of the Black Monday Depression"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Over a century has passed since the last major global war; over a century has passed for countries to reconsolidate their power and begin new campaigns for power. The old and stable world from before was gone; Kemmtik has begun a wide range of aggressive stances while Airabor is poised to strike its weaker neighbours. The stock market crash in 1934 had destabilized politics and the Continental Entente lays defunct. The armistice of a century has ran out, and now one can only wait out the gathering storm."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United Republic Democracy emerged as one of the 'Big Four' after the first global conflict a century ago. The cost of the war was extreme, and decades of political unrest and turmoil have not mixed well with an increasingly obsolete constitutional monarchy. The 1928 Market Crash in Londinium only served to later exacerbate the effects of Black Monday. \n\nAs other nations mobilize, the U.R.D. must adapt accordingly and find a way, whether diplomatically or aggressively, to secure Peace for our Time."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Just shy of a century ago, I.S.O.T.O.P.E. emerged onto the world stage as a country that recently consolidated its independence from a former major power. Though the country has prospered and became stronger, there is no doubt that a century of unrest has made the situation perilous.\n\nAs a major power decades ago, many opportunistic nations see I.S.O.T.O.P.E. as a power past its prime. It is quite obvious that I.S.O.T.O.P.E. must gather some old friends, or crumble alone in a hostile world."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Arislantia has stood in a position of prevalence in the century past. The once stable borders in central Europe have been rattled by threats from over the sea as well as a rapidly expanding Emerald Kingdom. In addition, the crash of the global stock exchange has affected Arislantia heavily.\n\nIn this new age of uncertainty, there is only one constant: Arislantia must unite from the inside or risk being annihilated from the outside."
 SWE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "For a century of peace from which other countries were attempting to recover from, Airabor has attempted to build up its war machine and reassert its power in the world stage. The last treaty held has been extremely unfair for Airabor, and a fascist regime has risen up to take back what they deserve.\n\nAs the shadow over Europe darkens, Airabor must find a place in the sun or risk losing to its fate."
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After a century of peace, the Kenu Republic has not been faring well. With a fragile democracy which has seemingly outlived its usefulness, the masses have been appealed towards a more radical approach for a government. With the Republic counting down the days it has, Kenu must find a path to prevail upon.\n\nA civil war between the two major extremist factions seems imminent, and Dragan Corp has become more assertive with its corporatism. Which way shall this empire tread to once again be glorious?"
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Empire of Japan stands at a crossroads. Hokushin-ron, the Northern Expansion Doctrine, is favored by the Army and calls for an advance into Siberia. Nanshin-ron, the Southern Expansion Doctrine, is supported by the Navy and has the rich European colonies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific as its target.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is always China. Japan possesses a formidable military, but its industries are starving for resources and time is running out. Which path to choose?"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the dust settled after the Russian Civil War, the U.S.S.R. had emerged as the undisputed ruler over most of what once constituted the Russian Empire. Rapid industrialization and collectivization followed, often at a great cost in human lives. \n\nThe Soviet Union is now faced with the threat of a resurgent Germany to the west, and a belligerent Japan in the east. Of course, there are also internal threats within the ranks of the Communist Party to contend with..."
 ICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Kemmtik was a great nation that was ungratefully done injustice by the peace a century ago. After half a century of turmoil and another half-century of rebuilding, Kemmtik has risen as an undisputed major power within Europe.\n\nThough the nation has done much and has achieved near greatness, to take that final step into its rightful place of domination, perhaps Kemmtik has plans for its old enemies. That taste of sweet revenge will dominate Kemmtik foreign policy."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States retreated back into isolation at the end of the last war and enjoyed a period of economic prosperity during the Roaring Twenties. This came to a dramatic end when the nation was gripped by the Great Depression.\n\nAmerica's policy of non-intervention in foreign wars has stood firm, but tensions are rising in both Europe and Asia. The 'Great Neutral' may find itself drawn into the maelstrom whether it wants to or not."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "As the largest power bloc in Europe, the Emerald Kingdom has eyed all of its neighbours with suspicion. After the end of the Middle European Entente, the Emerald Kingdom had embarked on adventures which saw the conquest of some of their smaller neighbors.\n\nThe Airish up north have become increasingly expansionist; the Soviets have begun to mass troops on their border again, perhaps a reminder is in order...\n\nHowever, for the Intermarium to become reality, the meddling West must be crushed."
 LAT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It took a long struggle with major powers to bring about the existence of Canasia. Its history dotted with bloodshed in the fight for independence, many countries have not forgotten their lost lands.\n\n With enemies below and above, how will Canasia weather themselves through this crisis?"
 AST_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War in blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipolli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, about to be drawn into yet another conflict in distant Europe, or should the focus be on the threats that are appearing closer to home?"
 SAF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The South African military spent most of the Great War chasing around German forces in their African colonies, with limited success. \n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in South Africa that think the country shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendents of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 NZL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Slabvia had been in decline for years now, its economic held hostage by imperial powers that did not care about the impacts of Slabvia on the world stage. However, unbeknownst to them, Slabvia has been gathering forces to become great again. \n\nThere is no illusion that Slabvia can triumph over all in the world. Slabvia will need to seek allies to survive and assert their position."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
 TUD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Far across the Atlantic, the Tudor States of America watch the gathering storm intensify. Having gained their independence early in the century, the fledgling republic has already fought 3 wars - two of them defensively. With their diverse ideology base, the Tudor States can go in any direction they please.   \n\nWith the stakes so high for all in the world, what choice will the Tudor States make? All that can be seen is that they will have a profound impact on a potential war in the future, for whichever side benefits."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Blitzkrieg"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last few years the world has seen some new wars break out in Europe and Asia. Spain is now governed by nationalists and Japan has fought both the Soviet Union and China for territory, the latter being a more successful battle for Japan. The new non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany may be bad news for the rest of Europe."
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Great War still fresh in its memory, France faces a new conflict after Germany showed they have no intention to keep the peace. Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely may very well be the way for France to avoid a disastrous war.\n\n France was victorious once before, this time shall be no different!"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War is raging in the Southeast. Even though Japan suffered some losses early in '39, a big portion of Chinese territory is under Japanese control. Tension is rising in Europe, and while the Soviet Union is focusing their attention on those matters, they shouldn't interfere in the war in Asia. \n\nWhen China's resources are in Japanese hands, the Soviets will be easy to deal with."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Mussolini, the dictator of Italy, achieved some fame as a peace keeper for his part in the Munich agreement a year ago. However, German territorial expansion has made Italy see there is more land to claim if an understanding with the Germans could be reached. \n\nAlbania has been conquered merely as a taste of Italy's military capabilities, and the rest of the world would do well to worry."
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould the United States get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nIn the west, German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" - and that the former German areas now under Polish control will be the first step to achieve it."
 CAN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Canada entered the Great War as a mere colony and left it as a nation. Born in the mud of Passchendaele, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage. \n\nHobbled by the Great Depression and with internal divisions between Anglophones and Francophones, the future of this new nation looks anything but secure."
 AST_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War in blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipolli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, about to be drawn into yet another conflict in distant Europe, or should the focus be on the threats that are appearing closer to home?"

Some even believe that the time has come for the descendants of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 NZL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in the Great War, suffering high casualties in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the western front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the fighting overseas, and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of the Great War, the people of New Zealand look anxiously at the world stage, for this time, the threat of war seems to draw ever closer to their own home..."
 RAJ_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
 CZE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "During the Great War, Czech troops fought alongside the Entente forces all over Europe in an effort to secure recognition for their nation. Their efforts were successful and Czechoslovakia rose from the ashes of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. \n\nSince their explosive entry into statehood Czechoslovakia formed the 'Little Entente' alliance with Yugoslavia and Romania with the aim of suppressing Hungary's efforts to restore the Austro-Hungarian Empire, although as resurgent German power grows the political landscape of Europe is rapidly changing."
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "One half of the late Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary was treated as a defeated enemy by the victorious Entente after the Great War. In the Treaty of Trianon, the country lost almost two thirds of its territory. Millions of ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside its borders, and its economy was left in ruins. Harsh restrictions on rearmament were supposed to ensure that Hungary could never again threaten the peace in Europe. \n\nBut with the political climate in Europe shifting, the time may have come to finally right the wrongs of the past, and regain the former glory of the nation."
 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After a rough few wars in the early 1900s, Romania stood at a precarious crossroads during the turmoil of the 20s, culminating in Senor Rous' seizure of power in 1928.\n\nHowever, although there is growth, not all is well in the Tudorreich. Many voices dissent against the flow, and most dangerous of them all are the whispers of the return of Senor Raud, co-revolutionary that had mysteriously disappeared years ago, which may topple the Tudorreich and cast the dream of the Desporeich into the depths."
 HUN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "One half of the late Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary was treated as a defeated enemy by the victorious Entente after the Great War. In the Treaty of Trianon, the country lost almost two thirds of its territory. Millions of ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside its borders, and its economy was left in ruins.

 ROM_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Romania found herself on the winning side of the Great War, and as a result gained new territories and people - not all of whom were Romanians. To guard against the revanchist desires of the countries that were forced to cede land, Romania has created a web of alliances all across the Balkans. In recent years, however, the country has concerned itself mostly with domestic matters, and the government of King Carol II has allowed these alliances to lapse. \n\nAs the political situation in Europe changes, Romania may well find herself standing alone - and vulnerable."
 YUG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Yugoslavia came into existence after the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes merged with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia in 1922. Initially Yugoslavia joined both the Little Entente and the Balkan Pact to secure their independence, but recently the assassination of King Alexander combined with growing internal pressure from nationalists and external pressure from Italy and Germany has caused drastic upheaval and reevaluation of their political and strategic position."

 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the revolution that deposed the last of the Qing Emperors, the young Chinese Republic has struggled to survive. Warlords rule much of the land on the periphery. In the heart of the country, the Communists have set up a base area in a remote mountain valley. Just beyond the borders, the Japanese have created a puppet government under the last Chinese Emperor and will try to reunite the country under his rule.\n\nWith many enemies threatening it, the government of Chiang Kai-Shek will have to make hard choices if it wants to survive and rule supreme in China."
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A mere two years ago, the Communist Party of China faced utter annihilation. To survive, it engaged on the epic journey that would become known as the Long March. With only a fraction of the army surviving the rigors of the march and little industry, the prospects of victory in the Chinese Civil War are slim indeed.\n\nBut in time, the population may be swayed to the Communist cause, new armies be raised, new base areas established, and, when the time is right, the revolutionary struggle will be renewed again, until final victory is achieved."
 CHI_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After two years of war against the Japanese, the armies of Chiang Kai-Shek have bled themselves white trying to stop the assault. The enemy has overrun the richest areas of the country. Little support has been forthcoming from the western democracies, and the Communist seem unwilling to engage the enemy in open battle.\n\nWith the war threatening to spread even further, it appears that the worst is still to come. But as the Japanese attack is slowed by the vastness of the country, they may well turn their gaze in other directions, and new alliances may yet turn the tide..."
 PRC_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Faced with an all-out Japanese attack, the Nationalists and Communists have struck an uneasy truce. Both sides are well aware that this United Front can not last. The Communist base area in Yan'an now forms the front line in the war against the Japanese.\n\nThe Communists must husband their resources carefully if they want to survive. Any casualties suffered in the fight against Japan will be felt twice over when the time comes to fight the war against the Nationalists, and this may well be what the government of Chiang Kai-Shek is counting on..."
 MAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Evicted from the Dragon Throne at the age of six, Puyi, the last Chinese Emperor, has been biding his time. While his former realm tore itself apart in the Chinese Civil War, Puyi found new allies in Japan.\n\nFor Puyi, the establishment of the Empire of Manchukuo in 1932 was but the first step in the quest to reclaim his ancestral birthright. For the moment, he is dependent on the Japanese Army to keep his rule, but in time, an opportunity might arise to cast off the shackles of servitude and become what he was born to be..."

 WARLORDS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The weakness of the Central Government may yet provide the opportunity for a sufficiently ambitious man to rise to power. At the periphery of the country, local leaders have carved out their own little fiefdoms, caring little for the orders of the Central Government. \n\nWar is on the horizon, and each of these Warlords faces a difficult choice: Collaboration with the Central Government or an alliance with the Communists? Either option promises a chance for a seat at the table, but there is a third possibility - to take China all for themselves."
 WARLORDS_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The war with Japan has forced the Chinese Warlords to pick a side. But there can be no doubt that this alliance is living on borrowed time. The day will come when it has outlived its usefullness, and on that day the game is once again open for every man ambitious and ruthless enough to make a play for the title of Ruler of China."
