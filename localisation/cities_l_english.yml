 cities.1.t:0 "The Fall of Stockholm"
 cities.1.d:0 "Reports say that Allied troops have just taken over the last district in the city of Stockholm, the capital of Airabor. After days of fighting in the urban area, the last Airish garrison has retreated towards Norrland and now the Allies are in full control of the city. It is believed that Stockholm Concert and City Hall have remained relatively undamaged; however, halfway through the battle, a bomb struck the Stockholm Telephone Tower, severing connections outside the city until the battle ended. Though the war situation for Airabor is now unstable, it seems as though they will fight on."

 cities.3.d:0 "While fighting still rages elsewhere in [FRA.GetNameDef], reports have come in of Kemmtik troops entering Paris. \n\nThe capital was declared an open city by I.S.O.T.O.P.E. forces moments before their last units retreated. Several columns of Kemmtik troops recreated the victory parade of 1813 by marching down the Champs-Élysées while Protonians looked on in stunned silence. \n\nMilitary experts predict that while fighting will continue on for extended amounts of time, an end to the organized defense of I.S.O.T.O.P.E. seems imminent."

 cities.4.d:0 "At dawn today, Kenu regiments drove past the Arc de Triomphe as fighting died down in Protonia. As organized resistance within the capital of I.S.O.T.O.P.E. came to an end, the Kenu Flag was seen hoisted up above the Eiffel Tower.\n\nThis marks the end of the Kenu campaign to securing I.S.O.T.O.P.E. lands and although the Neutron troops have declared the capital an open city, Kenu had famously said that 'Protonia shall burn with a passion'. It remains to be seen if that will be the fate of the capital."
