supreme.3.d:0 "Today, a record amount of trucks delivering all sorts of goods entered our country from the International Zone. One of the truck drivers, dressed formally with a pair of aviators, looked out towards our border checkpoint while smoking a cigar. He leaned back and drove his Citroen to the checkpoint. Although the border guard found his papers valid, something seemed off. As he began to drive out of the checkpoint, a few voices shouted out. A group of Containment Commission officers surrounded the Citroen, and apprehended the man as a spy from the Supreme. After extensive interrogation, it was found that he was sent to begin a civil war in Arislantia."
